<p>Hello! I am a student affairs professional at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Before I returned home to the beautiful Susquehanna Valley, I was a student of Hispanic linguistics. My interests include psycholinguistics, morphology (especially grammatical gender), multilingualism, and acquisition. I am a proud Pennsylvanian, born in magical Central Pennsylvania, and I spent my first two years of my undergraduate degree studying world languages education and English as a second language at the wonderful Penn State University. I transferred to the University of British Columbia, Okanagan, in Kelowna, BC, Canada in 2020 where I earned a Bachelor of Arts, specializing in Spanish, political science, and philosophy, in June 2022.</p>

<p>My master's thesis investigated the cross-linguistic gender congruency effect in English-French and French-English bilingual learners of Spanish, aiming to identify the roles of language typology and order of acquisition in third language acquisition and transfer. I have worked on research teams investigating the emergence and use of Spanish novel non-binary gender forms on social media, L3 acquistion of typologically-distinct languages, and changes in incremental sentence processing (prediction; using the visual world eye-tracking paradigm) as vocabulary size grows. I've dabbled in phonology (working with the Viby-i in Swedish), syntax (defending a notional view of syntactic imposters), and inclusive language in Spanish.</p>

<p>I am a native speaker of English and more-or-less fluent in Spanish, with just a touch of American Sign Language and French in my repertoireâ€“ Hebrew and Swedish, you're up next!</p>
  
<p>When I am not in class or teaching, you can probably find me crocheting, cross stitching, or editing my <a href="https://transientsmagazine.weebly.com">literary magazine</a>.</p>
